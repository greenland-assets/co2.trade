# co2.trade

**Infrastructure-grade verification logic for carbon assets.**

co2.trade is a source-led, one-page reference project that documents how carbon credits can be measured, verified, represented, and settled as digital assets — without relying on blind trust.

This repository hosts the public-facing specification layer of the project.

---

## Purpose

Carbon markets fail where verification, uniqueness, and settlement integrity break down.

The goal of co2.trade is not to issue carbon credits, but to define the **verification and settlement stack** that makes carbon assets auditable, machine-readable, and economically usable at infrastructure level.

---

## Conceptual Scope

co2.trade focuses on:

- Monitoring, Reporting and Verification (MRV)
- Registry anchoring and lifecycle integrity
- Token representation without double-counting
- Machine-to-Machine (M2M) settlement logic
- Security, audit, and protocol risk considerations

The project deliberately avoids:
- Project marketing
- Offset promotion
- Impact claims

co2.trade standardizes *how claims are verified and settled*, not *what should be claimed*.

---

## Why this exists

Carbon credits increasingly behave like financial instruments.

However, most platforms still rely on:
- opaque registries
- manual verification breaks
- unverifiable retirement semantics

co2.trade treats carbon assets as **environmental financial infrastructure**, not as narrative products.

---

## Architecture

- Static one-page site
- Hosted via GitHub Pages
- No backend
- No tracking
- No user data

Primary value lies in:
- semantic clarity
- machine-readable structure
- verifiable reference logic

---

## Standards & Anchors

The conceptual framework aligns with established bodies, including:

- EU Emissions Trading System (EU ETS)
- MRV standards and methodologies
- Registry-based asset lifecycle models
- Climate disclosure frameworks (TCFD / ISSB)
- Security principles known from institutional cyber risk management

All references are used as **verification anchors**, not endorsements.

---

## What this is not

- Not a trading platform
- Not a marketplace
- Not an offset issuer
- Not investment advice

co2.trade is a **reference layer**, not an execution layer.

---

## Status

Early-stage public specification.  
Stable content, intentionally low change frequency.

Future iterations may extend:
- M2M interface definitions
- formal verification schemas
- cross-registry mapping logic
